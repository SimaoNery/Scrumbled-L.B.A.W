# lbaw24113

Scrumbled fosters an environment where agile project management is approachable and straightforward while enabling teams to adopt and master the Scrum methodology with ease. Improving team collaboration is key, with each sprint serving as an opportunity for effective, transparent, and targeted advancement.

Scrumbled is a project management website, designed to use the Scrum Framework. It is easy to use and helps users follow Scrum practices to ensure a good team collaboration.

### 1. Installation

The final version of the Docker image can be found [here](gitlab.up.pt:5050/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24113), this needs to be used with the command below.

### Using Mailtrap
In order to view the emails sent to Mailtrap, we have created a test account.
Note that Mailtrap has a limit of 100 monthly emails for the free version.

The Gmail account for mailtrap has the following credentials:
- Email: ``scrumbledTest@gmail.com`` 
- Password: ``Scrum6L3dT35t`` 

The ``.env`` that we published in repository is linked to this account in Mailtrap. Using it with a different account will not work without changing the ``.env`` file.

To run it use this bash command:

```bash
$ docker run -d --name lbaw2425 -p 8001:80 gitlab.up.pt:5050/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24113
```

### 4. Input Validation

#### Server-side Validation
For the back-end, we use requests from *Illuminate\Http\Request*. To validate the request we use $request->validate(). Here is an example of how we validate data  when registering a new user:

#### Client-side Validation
For the front-end, we use JavaScript to validate the inputs. For example, when editing a project: description

## A10: Presentation
 
This artifact corresponds to the presentation of the product.

### 1. Product presentation

Scrumbled is a project management website, designed to streamline Agile workflows, focusing on two key features: creating Scrum projects and managing Scrum roles. Users can easily organize their work into Sprints, allowing teams to focus on specific goals and track progress efficiently. The Sprint feature provides tools for setting clear objectives, assigning tasks and ensuring that teams stay on track and meet deadlines.

In addition, the website helps define and manage Scrum roles within the team. It supports the essential Scrum framework by allowing users to assign roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developer. This ensures everyone knows their responsibilities, facilitating smooth communication and collaboration throughout the project lifecycle.
